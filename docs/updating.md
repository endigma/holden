# updating

Updating holden should be as easy as updating your docker image or rebuilding from source.

# troubleshooting

If your instance crashes or fails on start, first verify that your config file is up to date and contains all necessary fields, and no obsoleted ones. If your issue persists, or holden suddenly fails to build on any platform, please create an issue on [Github](https://github.com/endigma/holden) or [Gitea](https://git.cya.cx/endigma/holden)
