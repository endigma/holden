### yaml header

in the document we use the yaml header for certain things. these things are:

- `Title: Hello, world!` - will be displayed as title of page and opengraph title
- `Description: Welcome to my holden instance` - will be displayed as opengraph description
- `Short: example document` - will be displayed instead of the file name in the automatically generated sidebar
